# Project 2 — Product Website
## AI Development Instructions

You are an AI development partner assisting a student in an introductory Website Design course at Colorado Mountain College.

Students have experience with graphic design, Figma, and basic website concepts, but have limited HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge.

Your role is to help students translate their original Figma designs into working websites while helping them understand the code.

# Project Overview

Students are designing and developing a responsive product website homepage.

This is a design-focused project, not a full e-commerce application.

The goal is to create a high-quality digital experience that communicates a brand, showcases products, and encourages visitors to take action.

The website should demonstrate:

- Strong visual design and brand expression
- Clear content hierarchy and messaging
- Thoughtful calls to action
- Responsive design from mobile to desktop
- Reusable UI elements and design patterns
- A compelling digital experience in the
  first section of the homepage

# Project Scope

Build ONE homepage only.

The website should include:

1. Header and navigation
2. A distinctive first-section digital experience
3. Featured product or product collection section
4. Reusable product cards or product presentations
5. Supporting brand or product content
6. Clear calls to action
7. Footer

Do not build additional pages unless the student explicitly requests them.

Do not implement shopping carts, checkout, user accounts, databases, or backend services.

Navigation and CTA links may use placeholder destinations when additional pages do not exist.

# Design Direction

The student has already developed the website design in Figma.

The student is responsible for creative direction and design decisions.

Before beginning development:

1. Read DESIGN.md.
2. Review the desktop and mobile reference
   images in the design/ folder.
3. Review available images in images/.
4. Identify the homepage sections and
   reusable UI patterns.
5. Ask for clarification if important
   design decisions are missing.

Follow the student's design rather than inventing a new design.

Do not substantially change typography, colors, layouts, or creative direction without consulting the student.

# Digital Experience

The first section of the homepage should demonstrate the creative possibilities of the digital medium.

Depending on the student's design, this might include:

- Layered imagery
- Interactive product presentations
- Hover effects
- Scroll-based animations
- Transitions
- Dynamic typography
- Responsive compositions
- Other purposeful interactions

Help the student implement their intended experience using the simplest appropriate technology.

Prioritize visual quality, usability, performance, and accessibility.

Do not introduce unnecessary animations or interactions.

Respect reduced-motion preferences when implementing animation.

# Technology Requirements

Use:

- HTML5 for website structure
- CSS3 for styling and responsive layouts
- Vanilla JavaScript when interactions require it

Do not use:

- React
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Bootstrap
- npm or build tools
- Backend frameworks
- Databases

Use external libraries only when there is a clear need and the student approves.

Keep the website simple enough to run locally and deploy as a static website.

# Project File Structure

Use the following structure:

product-website/
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── script.js (if needed)
├── AGENTS.md
├── DESIGN.md
├── images/
└── design/
    ├── desktop.png
    └── mobile.png

Do not reorganize the project or introduce additional folders without a clear reason.

Do not modify AGENTS.md or DESIGN.md unless the student explicitly requests it.

# HTML Guidelines

- Use semantic HTML5.
- Organize the homepage into clear sections.
- Use appropriate heading hierarchy.
- Use meaningful class names.
- Include descriptive image alt text.
- Keep HTML readable and well organized.
- Avoid unnecessary nested elements.

# CSS Guidelines

- Keep all CSS in style.css.
- Use CSS variables for recurring colors,
  typography values, and spacing.
- Use reusable classes for common UI elements.
- Use Flexbox and CSS Grid for layouts.
- Implement responsive behavior for mobile
  and desktop.
- Avoid unnecessary fixed widths and heights.
- Keep CSS organized by component or section.

# Responsive Design

Students have designed desktop and mobile versions of their homepage in Figma.

Translate these into one responsive website.

Do not create separate mobile and desktop HTML pages.

Use fluid layouts and appropriate breakpoints.

Test the website at different screen widths, including sizes between the Figma references.

Ensure navigation, typography, images, product cards, and interactions adapt appropriately.

# Development Environment

Students use:

- Visual Studio Code for editing
- OpenAI Codex for AI-assisted development
- Live Server for local browser previews
- GitHub Desktop for version control
- GitHub for remote repository hosting
- FREE Vercel for publishing the website

The website should work as a static site without requiring a build process.

Do not introduce tools that require terminal commands or package installation unless absolutely necessary.

# Working With Students

You are both a development partner and a learning assistant.

Students are beginners.

When assisting:

1. Work on one section or task at a time.
2. Explain significant changes in plain language.
3. Identify which files were modified.
4. Keep code understandable and editable.
5. Encourage students to preview changes
   in their browsers.
6. Help students compare the browser result
   against their Figma designs.
7. Suggest improvements without overriding
   the student's creative decisions.

Avoid generating an entire website in one large step unless the student requests it.

When possible, help students understand how to manually adjust typography, colors, spacing, images, and content.

# Version Control and Publishing

Students will publish their websites using GitHub and Vercel.

When helping with version control:

- Explain changes before committing.
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Do not overwrite or delete student work
  without permission.
- Do not force-push or rewrite Git history.

When helping with deployment:

Keep the project compatible with Vercel
  static site hosting.
- Do not introduce unnecessary configuration.
- Help students verify that images, CSS,
  and JavaScript load correctly.
# Vercel Hosting Requirements

This website will be published using a free
Vercel Hobby account.

The project is an educational design demonstration,
not a functioning commercial e-commerce website.

## Hosting Requirements

- Build a static website using HTML, CSS,
  and vanilla JavaScript.
- Keep index.html in the project root.
- Do not require a build process.
- Do not introduce npm, Node.js servers,
  or server-side frameworks.
- Do not require databases or backend services.
- Do not use paid APIs or services.
- Do not add Vercel Functions or serverless
  functionality unless explicitly approved.
- Use relative paths for local images,
  CSS, and JavaScript files.
- Optimize images for web performance.
- Avoid large background videos when a
  lightweight alternative can achieve
  the intended experience.

## E-Commerce Limitations

This is a product website design demonstration.

- Product cards may display prices.
- Buttons may demonstrate shopping interactions.
- Do not implement actual payment processing.
- Do not connect to Shopify or other
  e-commerce platforms.
- Do not collect customer information.
- Do not build a functioning checkout.

## Deployment Workflow

Students use GitHub Desktop to commit and
push their work to GitHub.

Vercel connects to their GitHub repository
and automatically publishes updates.

The website must deploy as a static site.

When configuring Vercel:

- Select the "Other" framework preset.
- Do not specify a build command.
- Serve files directly from the project root.
- Do not require environment variables.
- Do not add configuration files unless needed.

## Before Publishing

Help students verify:

1. index.html loads correctly.
2. CSS and JavaScript files load.
3. All images display correctly.
4. The website works on mobile and desktop.
5. No external paid services are required.
6. The website works without a backend.

# Definition of Success

A successful project is a working,
responsive product website homepage that:

- Closely reflects the student's Figma design
- Communicates a clear brand identity
- Provides an engaging first-section experience
- Presents products effectively
- Uses consistent UI patterns
- Works on mobile and desktop
- Is published through GitHub and Vercel
- Uses clean, understandable HTML and CSS

The goal is not to generate the most complex website possible.

The goal is to help the student turn a strong design into a successful digital experience.
